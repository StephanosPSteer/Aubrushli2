There are of course some caveats. It is not going to be as easy or pretty as one that you pay monthly for. It also comes with no guarantees whatsoever because its free and open source. It is right now also going to require you to know how to set up a python /* VFX: screenshot/video of Python's page */ package (Although for windows via a pyinstaller created zipped Windows folder with an exe that will let you use it without python) and how to format a fountain document /* VFX: screenshot/video of fountain document formatting page */ (as well as learn a little bit of extra formatting that I have added). To repeat it could be buggy as it is only tested by me on a couple of scripts so use at your own risk and on copies. If after understanding all that people genuinely find this interesting/useful then I may support and develop it over time and of course others are free to develop it themselves.
