AUBRUSHLI is an app that I created to speed up my film production. It partially automates the process of extracting Cast lists, Breakdown Summaries and shot lists from screenplays. This reduces or eliminates transcribing time and leaves you with csv files which you can then directly print or modify in your favourite spreadsheet app. Today I am going to show you how to install and use AUBRUSHLI. In order to fully demonstrate its functionality I will be using this video's script as an example thats also why I'll be playing a few roles as well, plus its a laugh innit."", '', '/* SHOTEND 1: */']"

There are of course some caveats. Well obviously because its for the plebs. Its apparently not as user friendly, comprehensive or as aesthetically pleasing as the paid options. You get what you pay for in life my dear, well unless you rig the system, hahahaha, oh but I digress It also comes with no guarantees whatsoever. well what did you expect. AUBRUSHLI is probably not bullet proof enough for technophobes unlike my rolls in fact there are definitely some prerequisites you need before trying it. There is...euch!! a windows standalone executable but don't worry there is a Mac one too for the more discerning. You will need to know how to format a fountain document as well as learn a little bit of extra formatting needed for AUBRUSHLI to work. To repeat it could be buggy so use at your own risk, then again count yourself bloody lucky to be honest."", '', '/* SHOTEND 2: */']"

To create a shotlist is slightly more complex than a breakdown summary.
