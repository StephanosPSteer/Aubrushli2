# Aubrushli2
Version2 with killer feature: AUTOMATED SHOT LIST GENERATOR

Whole new codebase and extensive and innovative change to shotlists that mean instead of manually trawling a fountain document to mark shots, 

# Aubrushli 2 will give user defined (by default very extensive) coverage to ALL!!! Scenes within a script. 

I processed the BigFish fountain document from [Fountain.io](https://fountain.io/) as an example

and running Aubrushli 2 against that creates 190 shotlists taken from the scenes in the script and covering all actions with multiple shots!!!!

Here is an example of what A shotlist looks like in the new version.

Even from this limited view you can see coverage is extensive, probably too much but that is under the users control, using the easily modifiable shot_vals.csv

Will create a better readme for this soon 

# also note Windows Installer in releases.
